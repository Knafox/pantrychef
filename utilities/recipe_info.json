        "Cooking_Steps": "Slice the jalapenos in half lengthwise. Side note- if you slice the top off just before the stem it creates a notch to allow the top to sit evenly on the filling. Scrape all the seeds and veins out of the pepper= the better you scrape the less spicy these will be, but ultimately it depends on the spice factor of your bunch of peppers. Fill the bottom of the pepper with some ground beef- dont overfill. On top of the beef, add a layer of cream cheese ( I like extra) Sprinkle your seasoning on top of all the peppers. Put the tops back on and wrap the whole thing with bacon and secure with a toothpick. Put on a hot smoker and smoke for 1 hour or so until all the ground beef is cooked through. We have made these on a grill and in the oven and the smoker gives the best flavor. I know this is an old recipe, but trust me, they are awesome!",

I usually cut it up first cuz then you have nice, neat pieces and it doesnt get too crumbly. Just watch it so it doesnt burn. Unless you like burnt bacon. But thats weird. Roll out your dough. Its perforated into triangles, but I cut each triangle in half with a pizza cutter and do one popper on each half. Does that make sense? Sorry I didnt take pictures of that part. You can do it without cutting the crescents in half, and theyll just be a little bigger than bite size (and then the recipe will yield 8 larger poppers). Layer a small dollop of cream cheese, a piece or two of jalape\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00b1o, and bacon. Bring the corners of the dough together and twist them together at the top.

Wrap each potato bite in a piece of bacon, securing it with a toothpick. Put the potatoes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil spaced an inch or two apart. You may need to cook the potatoes in two batches. Cook the potatoes for 15 minutes, then flip each piece. Cook for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the bacon is cooked through and as crisp as you like it. Mix the sour cream and hot sauce in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Pile the potato bites on a plate and serve alongside the dip.",

        "Recipe_Name": "Bacon Wrapped Pretzel Sticks",
        "Ingredients": "1 Package Pretzel Rods 1 pound of regular bacon - regular cut, NOT thick cut 2 cups Brown Sugar 3-4 Tbsp Red Chili Powder (or most to taste if you want them real spicy) Dash or two (or three!) Cayenne Pepper",
        "Cooking_Steps": "Break the pretzels in half; I actually have the best luck if I cut them with a very sharp knife. Cut the bacon slices into half. Mix the sugar, chili powder and cayenne in a medium size bowl and then spread it out on a large flat dish. Coat each strip of bacon on both sides with the brown sugar mixture.Press firmly to make sure a lot of it adheres to the bacon. Wrap the bacon around the pretzel. Place the delicious treat on a wire rack placed on top of a baking sheet or roasting pan; I try to make sure that the tail end of the bacon I just wrapped is on the bottom to try and avoid having it unwrap during cooking. Bake at 375 for about 10 minutes or until bacon cooks and appears crisp. IMPORTANT: Let cool on wire rack and rearrange occasionally while cooling so they dont stick to rack. Do not put these on paper towels; they are sticky! NOTES Thicker cut is not better. You need the bacon to cook without burning the pretzels...so regular bacon is best. I know...I tested this theory once. Trust me.",

        "Cooking_Steps": "1. Prepare the spicy cilantro mayo: In a medium bowl, combine mayonnaise, hot chili paste, lime juice and cilantro; stir well. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. 2. Prepare the scallops: Preheat your oven broiler. Spray a rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Wrap each scallop with a piece of bacon and secure with a wooden toothpick. Place the bacon-wrapped scallops onto the prepared baking sheet and season them with salt and pepper. Cook them under the broiler for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the bacon is cooked through- turning once mid-way through. 3. To serve, line a large platter with lettuce leaves and place the bacon-wrapped scallops on top. Serve with a dish of the spicy mayonnaise for dipping. Tips: *The number of scallops this recipe will yield depends entirely on the size of your scallops. I like to use large scallops. They shrink a little bit during the broiling process, but they make a nice and hearty appetizer. Tiny scallops just arent very exciting. *Ground chili paste can usually be found in your markets Asian products aisle (I used one called Sambal Oelek). If you have something similar- maybe another spicy sauce, try substituting that (just add a little at a time until you reach your desired level of heat). *Make ahead tip: Make the sauce ahead of time and refrigerate. Wrap all of your scallops and refrigerate, then just put them under the broiler when youre ready to serve! more at recipegirl.com",

        "Cooking_Steps": "Combine all of the meatball ingredients in a medium bowl. DO NOT ADD SALT!!! The Franks is super salty as is the blue cheese so trust me you dont need to add more. The mix will be sticky and gooey but thats normal. Form into about 1 inch balls - remember these are cocktail/bite sized so dont make them too big. Place them on a greased cookie sheet (with sides) and bake at 350 degrees (F) for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the Franks and butter in a small saucepan on medium heat, or place in a microwave safe bowl for 2 minutes on high. After 10 minutes, remove balls from oven and dunk carefully (they are tender from the cream cheese and could fall apart if you are too rough) in the buffalo sauce. Put back onto the cookie sheet and bake for another 12 minutes. If you have leftover sauce you could pour it over the meatballs and bake for another 3 to 4 minutes if you want them really saucy.",

        "Recipe_Name": "Buffalo Chicken Bites",
        "Ingredients": "1 cup shredded chicken 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese 1/4 cup hot sauce 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar 1 cup warm milk (about 110 F, I used 1%)) 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast 1/4 teaspoon salt",
        "Cooking_Steps": "To make the buffalo chicken mixture: Combine the chicken, cheese, hot sauce and butter in a medium bowl. Stir to combine. The mixture may seem too wet, but the chicken will absorb some of the sauce. To make the dough: Combine the warm milk and brown sugar in a measuring cup, and stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the flour, yeast and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on low briefly just to combine. With the mixer on low, gradually pour the milk/sugar mixture into the mixer and beat until a rough dough forms. Switch from the paddle attachment to the dough hook. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. You want the dough to clear the sides of the bowl as it kneads - if its not, add a tablespoon of flour at a time until it does. The dough should be tacky, but not sticky. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and shape into a ball. Spray a large bowl with nonstick cooking spray and add the ball of dough, turning to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until doubled in size, about 90 minutes. You can tell if the dough has doubled by sticking your finger in and making an impression. If the impression remains, you are ready to move on, but if it springs back, the dough hasnt risen enough. Preheat oven to 400 F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and cut it into 4 equal pieces. Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough into a 12-inch rope. Use your fingers to flatten the dough into a rectangular shape, then use a rolling pin to roll to a roughly 12x4-inch rectangle. Add 1/4 of the buffalo chicken mixture to the lower third of the rectangle (make sure to leave a border along the bottom). Stretch the bottom edge of the dough up and over the filling, pressing to seal. Starting at the bottom, roll up the dough as tightly as possible. Cut the log into 12 even pieces and transfer them to the prepared sheet pan. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough and chicken mixture. Let the bites rise at room temperature (uncovered) for about 20-30 minutes - the dough will rise slightly. Bake the bites for about 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack , and if desired, brush the tops with melted butter before serving. (Note: You can make the bites a few hours ahead of time. Just reheat them in a 350 F oven for about 5 minutes when youre ready to serve.)",

        "Cooking_Steps": "Brown the hamburger and drain any grease.If using chicken, cut it in very small pieces before browning it. Add the taco seasoning to the meat after browning adding the water per instructions. While the meat is cooking, chop the onions, drain the chiles, and shred the cheese (unless like me, you buy the already-shredded). If using corn tortillas heat in small amount of oil but do not cook them hard. This is just to soften them. Many Latino cooks place a bit of enchilada sauce in the oil. Be careful if you try this method..it splashes. Flour tortillas can just be heated slightly before filling them or placing them in baking dish with a small amount of enchilada sauce when making casserole. To make regular enchiladas: Place some enchilada sauce in the bottom of baking dish THEN place about a TBLS of meat in each tortilla, some cheese, chiles, onions, and sour cream and some enchilada sauce. Roll and place each one in a baking dish. Top with enchilada sauce, sour cream, cheese, a few olives and heat until bubbly or about 30 minutes. To make the casserole: Place some enchilada sauce on the bottom of pan. Place a layer of tortillas, meat, cheese. chiles, onions, and sour cream. Add another layer of tortillas and meat, etc if you have enough. If not just place a few tortillas on top. THEN place more sauce, sour cream. cheese, and chiles and a few olives sprinkled over all.

        "Cooking_Steps": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat. Add onion (very finely chopped because the frittatas will be small and you dont want big chunks of onion); saute 2 minutes or until crisp-tender and lightly browned. Add ham; saute about 3 minutes Remove from heat; let cool while you combine the other ingredients. Combine eggs, pepper, thyme, cayenne, and cheese in a large bowl; stir with a whisk. Add ham and onion mixture, stirring with a whisk. Spoon mixture into 24 miniature muffin cups coated with cooking spray. Each cavity will only hold about two teaspoons of the mixture. It wont seem like enough but remember they will puff up during cooking. They do end up fairly small, but if serving as an hour derves they are the perfect size for a one bite treat. If you want them bigger, like the size of a mini cupcake, they only fill 12 of the cavities in the mini muffin tin. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes or until set.",

        "Cooking_Steps": "Combine the yeast, 1 tsp brown sugar, and warm water in a large bowl. Set aside until foamy, 5-8 minutes. (If using the instant yeast, you can skip this step and just add it to the flour.) In another bowl, stir together the remaining 2 Tbsp brown sugar and warm milk until dissolved. Add 2 1/2 cups flour and milk mixture to the yeast. Stir with a wooden spoon until a soft dough forms. Add the remaining flour as needed. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead a few times, forming a smooth ball. Brush the inside of a large clean bowl with olive oil. Transfer the dough to the bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow to rise in a warm, draft free area for about 2 hours, until dough has doubled in size and bubbles appear on the surface. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into 4 equal pieces. Lightly dust your hands and rolling pin with flour. Roll one of the four sections into a 12\u00d74-inch rectangle. With the long side facing you, gently press 1/4 of the ham and cheese into the bottom third of the dough, and roll as tightly as possible, starting with the end that has the filling. Cut into 12 1-inch pieces and transfer to a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Repeat with remaining 3 portions of the dough. Let rest, uncovered, at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400?F. Bring 6 cups of water to a boil. Add the baking soda and reduce heat to a gentle simmer. Boil pretzels in batches, cooking about 20 seconds each, turning once. They should be slightly puffed. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them back to the baking sheets. Bake until puffed and golden-brown, about 15 minutes.

        "Recipe_Name": "More Bacon Cheddar Potatoes",
        "Ingredients": "1/2 pound bacon , 3 extra large russet potatoes, peeled and chopped into 1/2\"-3/4\" pieces, about 6 cups worth , 1 teaspoon kosher salt , 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper , 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar or Mexican blend shredded cheeses , 3 green onions, sliced thin ,",
        "Cooking_Steps": "COOK THE BACON: Spread the bacon strips out across a large rimmed baking sheet pan and place on the middle rack of a COLD oven. Set the temperature to 400 degrees. Set a timer for 16 minutes and check the bacon. Remove it from the oven when it is as crisp or crunchy as you like. I remove ours at 18 minutes and its a great balance of chewy crunch. If you like your bacon crispy enough to crumble, you will probably want to cook it another minute past that. COOK THE POTATOES: While the bacon is cooking, peel and chop the potatoes. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel lined plate to drain. There should be 2-3 tablespoons of bacon grease left on the tray. (If there is more than that, drain off a bit.) Put the potatoes on the tray and toss with tongs to thoroughly coat them in the bacon grease. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread the potatoes out in a single layer and bake for 20 minutes, stir well and bake an additional 20 minutes. Stir again, making sure that none of the potatoes are sticking to the tray. Bake another 15 minutes. Chop the bacon into small pieces. Remove the potatoes from the oven, stir again and sprinkle generously with shredded cheese and chopped bacon. Return the tray to the oven and bake an additional 2-3 minutes, until the cheese has melted. Top with sliced green onions just before serving. from LittleFawnClothing - more here!!",

Uncooked bacon may be used but it takes longer to cook (they need broiling) at the last minute. 4 To serve: Arrange on baking tray (or plate for microwave) and heat in hot oven, 400\u00c2\u00b0F (200\u00c2\u00b0C) until sizzling hot.

If difficulty is experienced in rolling out the dough, allow it to rest for a few minutes. Ive found that pulling the dough with my hands works best. 6 Spread the Thousand Island dressing on the dough, then add corn beef, sauerkraut, and cheese, leaving some of the cheese exposed so that it can help hold the roll together as it bakes. 7 Starting with the long end roll the dough into a log. 8 NOTE: Cut only the number of pieces you want to bake.

For the most neat looking slices, treat it as a cheesecake \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 each time slice it with a hot dry knife. more at bakingobsession.com",

Add minced garlic and saute about 1 minute more, being careful not to brown the garlic. Remove the onion, pepper, and garlic mixture to a bowl. Add 2 tsp. more olive oil to the pan. Crumble in the ground beef and ground turkey, season with Spike seasoning, and cook over medium heat until the meat is well browned. Tilt pan to see if there is any extra fat, and remove with a spoon if there is, then stir cooked vegetables and garlic back into the meat. Add tomato sauce and simmer until the mixture has thickened and liquid has cooked off, about 10 minutes, then turn off heat. While meat cools, cut zucchini into 2 inch thick slices, discarding ends. Use a sharp spoon or melon baller to hollow out a cup in each zucchini slice, leaving just over 1/4 inch of zucchini flesh. Be careful not to get too close to the skin or the cups will leak liquid when they cook. Spray baking sheet with nonstick spray and stand up zucchini cups, open end up. Stir 1 1/2 cups grated cheese into the cooled meat mixture (it doesnt need to be completely cool), then spoon the meat-cheese mixture into zucchini cups, pressing down with the spoon and mounding it up a little over the top of the zucchini. Bake zucchini cups for 20 minutes, then remove from oven and use remaining cheese to top each one with a generous pinch of cheese. Put back in oven and bake 10-15 minutes more, until zucchini is slightly soft when pierced with a fork and cheese is melted and lightly browned. Serve hot.",

If using a thermometer let the temperature reach 375\u00b0. If you dont have a fancy gadget like most people, I always test my oil by dropping a few drops of water into it. You want it to sizzle and not pop too much. Adjust your heat if necessary. Using a fork or tongs remove cut chicken from milk mixture and place in the flour mixture. Seal and shake until nuggets are completely coated. Place about a 6-8 nuggets into hot oil and let them cook until golden brown, turning half way through once the edge of your chicken starts to turn white. About 1 minute each side. Always double check to see if any chicken you make is cooked through. I always just make a tiny cut to see if its pink. Remove and drain on a paper towel. Repeat until all nuggets are cooked.

        "Cooking_Steps": "1. Place the grated zucchini and potato in a colander. Spread the veggies out to allow for maximum surface area exposure and sprinkle all over with kosher salt. Let sit for at least 30 minutes to drain. 2. Meanwhile, make the tzatziki, if desired: Stir together yogurt, onion, mint, salt and lemon juice. Taste. Add more salt if necessary. Chill until ready to use. 3. After the 30 minutes, squeeze veggies out and wrap in paper towels. Squeeze again. Note: The veggies will not drain out enough liquid on their own in the collander, so squeezing them with a paper towel is a critical step to mopping up that moisture. Open up the paper towel and spread out your veggies. Sprinkle with a pinch of flour to soak up leftover moisture. 4. In a bowl, whisk together egg, herbs and lemon zest. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add onion and grated zucchini-potato mixture. Stir well. 5. Preheat over to 200\u00cb\u0161F. Place a foil-lined cookie sheet in the oven. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter. When foam subsides, drop a spoonful of your fritter batter in. Gently pat with a spatula to flatten out the fritters, which will help make them crispy. 6. Cook about 3 fritters at a time until golden brown on each side. Place fritters in the oven while you make additional pancakes. Serve as soon as possible with tzatziki on the side.

        "Cooking_Steps": "The cakes can be kept frozen, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 3 weeks. Defrost them at room temperature before unwrapping. Frost immediately). <ul To make the icing: In a medium stainless-steel bowl, combine the unwrapped caramels, 2 tablespoons of the cream, and the 2 tablespoons butter. Place over a saucepan filled with 2 inches of simmering water. Stir the caramel mixture until smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat. Let cool, stirring the mixture every few minutes until cool to the touch, about 20 minutes. (If the mixture is too warm, it will melt the buttercream frosting when it is stirred in later.) While the caramel is cooling, make the butter cream: Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the 1 1/2 cups butter on medium-high speed for about 1 minute, until pale in color. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons cream and the vanilla and powdered sugar, and beat for 3 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the mascarpone and beat on medium-low speed until incorporated. Do not overbeat the mascarpone, or it may separate. Reserve 1/4 cup of the cooled caramel mixture to drizzle over the cake once it is frosted. Stir the remainder of the caramel into the frosting, using large strokes to create caramel swirls throughout. Dont stir it too much or the ribbons of caramel will disappear. Place one cake layer on a serving plate and spread a thick blanket of frosting on top. Add the second layer and spread thickly with frosting. Add the third layer and cover the top and sides of the cake with an even layer of frosting. Use a small spoon to drizzle the reserved 1/4 cup of caramel over the top of the cake. Pat on the toasted pecan pieces to cover the sides of the cake. Tip: Using the proper tools for cutting frosted layer cakes ensures that individual servings look as good as they taste. I use a large serrated knife dipped in hot water for cutting. I wipe the knife off with a clean dishcloth after each piece, which ensures that every cut is as clean as the first.",

While the bacon is cooking, combine the flour, chives, baking powder, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Stir in the milk, egg and oil, just until moistened. Stir in the bacon mixture, corn and cheese. The mixture will be thick. If youd like the griddle cakes to be slightly thinner than those pictured, add a little more milk to thin out the batter. 3. Heat and grease a griddle or large skillet. Pour a heaping 1/4-cup of the batter onto the griddle and cook until it is golden brown- 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining batter. 4. Serve stacks of griddle cakes topped with a sprinkle of the reserved bacon/onion and a good dose of warm maple syrup. more at recipegirl.com",

        "Cooking_Steps": "Start by cooking your sausage in a skillet over medium - medium high heat. Remove from heat, and set aside in a bowl when the sausage is fully cooked through and no pink remains. Break the sausage up with a spatula during the cooking process. In the same skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter and add in diced onion, red and green pepper. Cook until the peppers are softened to your liking, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and set aside. Again, in the same skillet, melt another tablespoon of butter and add in whisked eggs. Cook until *almost* set. The eggs will still be a little runny and shiny, but youll remove the pan from the heat, and they will continue to cook. Add in cooked sausage, veggies, cheese, and black beans. Mix together and season with more salt to your liking. Now, lay an egg roll wrapper on your counter at an angle. It should look like a diamond. About \u00bd inch from the bottom corner, place 2 tablespoons of the egg mixture. Take the bottom corner of the egg roll wrapper and lift it up and over the mixture. Next, take the right corner and fold it to the center. Do the same with the left corner. Now just roll until you only have a little triangle left at the top of the egg roll wrapper. Wet the seam with water, and continue rolling. Now, comes the frying part! Let me tell you IT IS NOT HARD! I promise. Fill the saucepan with about 1 inch of vegetable oil and heat over medium heat. Once the oil reaches 325 degrees F you can start cooking the egg rolls! Id suggest cooking them one at a time. It should take less than 30 seconds. Flip the egg roll over and move it around a little bit to ensure even cooking. When theyre done, they will be golden brown. Once golden brown, remove from the oil and set onto a paper towel to drain. Serve immediately with sour cream and salsa and enjoy!",

Gently break up any overly-large pieces with your hands. 2.Toast the English muffins: Use a fork to work your way around, splitting the muffins in half horizontally. (A fork leaves a much nicer, textured landscape than a knife. If that means nothing to you, by all means, go at it with a knife.) Place under the broiler for 1 minute, or until toasty. 3.Make the Hollandaise sauce: In a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, whisk egg yolks with water, whisking vigorously, until mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in lemon juice. Whisk in 1-2 pieces of butter at a time until melted. Season with salt. Serve sauce immediately, or keep warm over the doubler boiler, whisking occasionally and adding 1-2 tsp hot water if the sauce thickens too much. 4.Poach the eggs: Bring a medium pot of salted water to a simmer. Crack the eggs into a small bowl. Using a large spoon, swirl the water in the pot and then gently tip the eggs into the center of the whirlpool. Use a slotted spoon to remove the eggs after about 3 1/2 minutes. 5.Assemble: Build from the bottom up: English muffin, King Crab, poached egg, Hollandaise sauce.",

If you dont have a ricer, use paper towels to squeeze out as much moisture as you can from the grated potatoes. 3 When the oil in the pan heats up to the point of shimmering, but not smoking, add the grated potatoes, spreading them out along the bottom of the pan. The potatoes should not be too thick in any one place, no more than a half inch thick. Sprinkle some salt and pepper on the potatoes. After a few minutes, lift up one edge of the potatoes and see how done they are. If they have fried to a golden brown they are ready to flip. Use a large spatula to flip the potatoes over all at once, or divide the large potato cake into halves or quarters and flip. Continue to cook until they are golden brown on the bottom.",

        "Cooking_Steps": "Preheat oven to 475 Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add eggs and boil 4-5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Cube butter and toss in the freezer until needed. Cold better works best for biscuits! Combine the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse 1-2 times until combined. Drop in the COLD butter and pulse a few times until mixture is crumbly. Stop at this point - dont want to overmix! Add the cheese and pulse until just combined. Transfer into a bowl and gently fold in the chives. Stir the yogurt up and add to the mix. Combine with a rubber spatula until just combined. Spray a baking sheet with baking spray. Remove eggs from shells. Using roughly 1/4 c. of dough, shape into a biscuit and place onto baking sheet. Press a well into the center. Place the egg in the well sideways. Form another biscuit and place on top of the egg, forming the biscuit around the egg. Easily use extra dough to cover up the sides of the eggs. Bake for 5 minutes, then reduce the heat to 400 and bake another 6-7 minutes until golden brown. Top with melted butter and extra chives submitted by Marc - VodkaAndBiscuits.com - more details here!

Grab the sides and start pulling them to the top and then pinch to close. Dont be afraid to pull out those sides and up. Turn pinched side down on a greased pan. Beat one egg and add a Tablespoon of water. Brush tops of Biscuits with egg to give it a nice brown to it. Season with salt and pepper. Cook the biscuits as per the instructions (mine was at 425 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes). Every oven varies so I would check at 8 and if they arent brown yet wait and check again until they are done. You can dress them up however you like... Gravy is AWESOME!, but so is a little salsa and avocado :) Great leftovers, you can eat them for days - great for when you need a quick breakfast, just reheat and eat.",

Cook in your slow cooker on high for 3-4 hours or low for 5-6 hours, until the meat is very tender. Remove the meat to a cutting board and thinly slice it or shred it with a fork and set aside. Place a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and carefully pour the juices from the slow cooker through the strainer and into the bowl (this is your au jus). Set aside the onions that remain in the strainer, discard the bay leaf. Transfer the sliced meat and the onions back into the slow cooker. Pour over a little bit of au jus to moisten the meat (season to taste with salt and pepper). Reserve the remaining au jus for dipping. If youd like more au jus, you can stir in a little beef broth to make it stretch farther. Toast your rolls, pile with meat and onions, cover with the cheese of your choice. If you want the cheese melted you can place it in a 375\u00b0 oven or under the broiler until melted. Serve with the au jus on the side for dipping.",

Sprinkle 2/3 of brown sugar cinnamon mixture over apples and cover with the rest of the batter. Sprinkle the rest of the brown sugar cinnamon mixture over the top. Bake for 45-55 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. For Glaze: While the cake is baking, make the glaze. In a bowl, mix the powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk until the glaze is desired consistency. When the cake comes out of the oven, immediately but carefully pour onto hot cake. Try to pour as evenly as possible. You might have to pick up the cake and tilt it to spread the glaze evenly. I even poured some out that pooled at the corners and repoured that over the top. Let the cake sit for awhile for the glaze to set. From LeClubCooking - more here!",

In a 9\" tart/cake pan, press dough evenly around pan, roughly 1/4\" in thick and poke several holes in the bottom with a fork to let steam out. 4. Place tart pan with crust inside the oven for 15 minutes until crust becomes golden brown (blind baking). 5. Remove when slightly firm and cool. The Filling: 1. Mix cream cheese and sugar in a bowl until smooth. 2. Spread evenly over cooled crust. 3. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes until slightly firm. 4. Remove and cool in the refrigerator. Arranging the Roses: 1. Thinly slice apples with a mandolin or knife, the thinner the better. 2. Put all slices into a large microwaveable bowl, and mix in water and sugar. 3. Microwave on high for 2 minutes, until apple slices are pliable. 4. Roll 6 thin slices into 6 small rolls. These will serve as the center for the roses. 5. Arrange each roll around the tart, pressing them into the now cooled, slightly firm filling. The cream cheese filling will hold the apples in place. 6. One at a time, arrange apple slices around the center of one rose until the rose is big enough. 7. Repeat process with remaining 5 roses, making sure that each rose is similar in size. 8. After all 6 roses are complete, fill in remaining gaps between the 6 roses with small rolls of apples. These are the \"buds\" or the \"small roses\". 9.

If you choose blueberries and bananas, you can use mixed berry jello - be creative! DO NOT MAKE THE JELLO!! If you like a \"full\" pie crust, I suggest using the 16 oz. cool whip. Fold the dry jello into the plain cool whip (I do believe there is a strawberry flavored cool whip now, so that might be an option for your filling). Make sure the granules are dissolved, so it will folded for some time. Once its not \"gritty\", take your clean, dry berries (slice them if needed) and gently fold them into the cool whip mixture. Then, add your bananas and gently fold them into your filling mixture.

        "Ingredients": "8 ounces chocolate (choose a high quality chocolate you love) 3/4 cup (6 ounces) water ice cubes",
        "Cooking_Steps": "Simply pour water into a saucepan (which will be improved from the gastronomic point of view if it is flavored with orange juice, for example, or cassis puree). Then, over medium-low heat, whisk in the chocolate. The result is a homogenous sauce. Put the saucepan in a bowl partly filled with ice cubes (or pour into another bowl over the ice -- it will chill faster), then whisk the chocolate sauce, either manually with a whisk or with an electric mixer (if using an electric mixer, watch closely -- it will thicken faster). Whisking creates large air bubbles in the sauce, which steadily thickens. After a while strands of chocolate form inside the loops of the whisk. Pour or spoon immediately into ramekins, small bowls or jars and let set. Note: Three things can go wrong. Heres how to fix them. If your chocolate doesnt contain enough fat, melt the mixture again, add some chocolate, and then whisk it again. If the mousse is not light enough, melt the mixture again, add some water, and whisk it once more. If you whisk it too much, so that it becomes grainy, this means that the foam has turned into an emulsion. In that case simply melt the mixture and whisk it again, adding nothing. Serve immediately, or refrigerate. Top with whipped cream if desired You can get different textures depending on when you stop whisking: 1) For a mod, flat-topped look, like sexy pot de creme: pour it into ramekins while its thickened, but still a bit warm. 2) When it gets to the texture of thick pudding, you can spoon it into a glass parfait-style, like little chocolate snowdrifts (as in our photos). At this stage, our Assistant Editor Nozlee Samadzadeh has also used it to frost a cake. 3) Whip it just a bit further for something fluffy you can ball up in an ice cream scoop, if thats what youre going for. Beyond this, and it gets crumbly and dry (though still tasty).",

Stir in applesauce, vanilla (just a tiny bit, were talking drops), flour, baking powder, and pinch of salt; stirring until just combined. Use the back of your spoon to smooth it out in the bottom of the mug. 2.Want struesel? Of course you do! In a separate, small bowl, combine 1 tbsp of butter, 2 tbsp of flour, 1 tbsp of brown sugar, and 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Use your fingers to to pinch the butter and mix it in with the other ingredients. When it starts to look like lumpy sand (appetizing, eh?) and all ingredients are combined, pour on top of cake batter in mug. 3.Cook in the microwave for 50-80 seconds depending on your microwave. At 1 minute, my microwave cooks it perfectly. It will look just barely set on top. You dont want to overcook it and things tend to get ugly fast in the microwave. I suggest cooking it 50 seconds, and then in 10 second intervals checking after each interval until done. Eat white its still warm. Once it cools off, it tends to loose some of its magic!

Remove the inside of each apple with a spoon or melon baller very carefully, as to not puncture the peel. Step 2: Remove skin from remaining apple(s) and slice very thinly. These apple pieces will give you the additional filling needed to fill the four apples you are baking. Mix sliced apples with sugars and cinnamon in a bowl. If you prefer more or less cinnamon make adjustments as desired. Same goes for the sugar. Scoop sliced apples into hollow apples Step 3: Roll out pie crust and slice into 1/4 inch strips. You can also add a strip of pastry inside the top of the apple almost like a liner to add a little more texture/sweetness to the pie. Cover the top of the apple in a lattice pattern with pie crust strips. Step 4: Place apples in an 8\u00c3\u0192\u00e2\u20ac\u201d8 pan. Add just enough water to the cover the bottom of the pan. Cover with foil and bake for 20-25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes or until crust is golden brown and sliced apples are soft. more at domesticdilettante.com",

Melt 1 1/4 cups of chocolate chips (I do mine in the microwave, heating on full power for 20 seconds, stir, 30 seconds again, and stir until melted). Drop 1/2-1 teaspoon of chocolate into each liner, then use a pastry brush to brush chocolate up the sides of the liner. Place in the freezer for 20 minutes. By this point the butter + sugar mix should be cool. Whisk in powdered sugar, salt and flour, until combine and few lumps remain. Fold in mini chocolate chips. The dough will be wet, but pop it in the fridge for 15 minutes to harden. Remove muffin tin and cookie dough, then place 1 teaspoon of cookie dough (I somewhat rolled mine) into the chocolate cups. Place back in the freezer for 10-15 minutes. Melt the remaining chocolate chips, then cover each cookie dough top with chocolate, smoothing with a spoon. Freeze again for 15-20 minutes. These are fine out in room temperature for a few hours (they may soften a bit) but I like them best stored in the fridge. Note: Im sure if you temper your chocolate and let it sit at room temperature these will harden without the freezer, but this is what works for me best. more at howsweeteats.com",

Put the frozen slices in a food processor and pulse. First they will start to resemble gravel, but keep going. The bananas will soon turn into a frozen mush at this point, start scraping the sides down (you will do this a lot). Or you could add a dash of milk since the liquid will help the blending. After a few minutes of stopping to scrape the sides down, the banana begins to blend into a creamy texture. When the bananas look like whipped ice cream, you can add your mix-ins like peanut butter and/or cocoa powder, chocolate chips, toffee, raspberries, anything goes! Straight out of the food processor, the ice cream is like soft serve. You can also freeze it for a firmer texture. I find its pretty hard (and therefore, brittle) when I scoop it immediately after removing it from the freezer. Just give it a minute or two to soften up. Makes a pint.",

If it is a fruit with seeds, a food mill will remove the seeds more easily than a food processor and strainer. Add a small amount of water to the mixture if necessary so that it has a pourable consistency. 3.Cover a baking sheet with plastic, parchment paper, or a silicon baking pad. The temperature of the oven is low enough not to affect the plastic. (Note: wax paper will not work for this recipe, it will stick.) 4.Spray or brush with vegetable oil, then spread the fruit puree onto the sheet tray with an offset spatula or knife to 1/8-1/4 inch thickness.

Dip, Chill, and Enjoy! Place the chocolate chips and shortening in a double boiler that is sitting over water that is barely simmering. Stir just until the chocolate is melted, then remove from the heat. Place one of the peanut butter balls on a fork (preferably one with long tines), and lower into the melted chocolate. Carefully turn until completely coated, then place the fork under the ball and lift it from the chocolate.

Seal it up, getting rid of as much air as you can. Now double bag it inside a similar-sized bag. 2 Throw 4 cups of crushed or cubed ice with 6 tbsp of salt in a large freezer bag. You can use any kind of salt, as you wont actually be eating it. The salt is there to lower the freezing point of water, if you want to get technical. Put in your little double bag, and seal the large bag around it, getting rid of as much air as possible. 3 Now for the fun part\u2014get shaking baby! Wrap the bag in a tea towel, or use gloves if you arent feeling hardcore, but otherwise just shake the bag for at least five minutes before checking on its progress. 4 You\u2019ll start to notice it getting thicker by simply feeling through the bag. In eight minutes max, you should have some seriously delicious ice-cream; it will take longer if you are mixing a large batch. 5 When you remove the smaller bag, wipe it down carefully to get rid of all the salt on the outside. Now that you know the basic steps, get creative and up the yum factor by using flavored milk, adding some fruit puree towards the end of the process, or even a spoon or two of ready-made fudge sauce. You can also try substituting cream in place of milk for a bit more calorie dense, but super yummy treat.",

Stir together the lemon juice and sugar until the sugar is completely dissolved. Once dissolved, continue to cook for 3 more minutes. Remove from the heat; set aside. Use a toothpick to poke holes in the tops and sides of the warm loaf. Brush the top and sides of the loaf with the lemon syrup. Let the syrup soak into the cake and brush again. Let the cake cool completely. To make the lemon glaze, in a small bowl, whisk together the confectioners\u2019 sugar and 2-3 tablespoons of the lemon juice. The mixture should be thick but pour-able. Add up to another tablespoon of lemon juice if the mixture is too stiff. Pour the lemon glaze over the top of each loaf and let it drip down the sides. Let the lemon glaze harden for about 15 minutes extras: This recipe will also yield about 12 standard muffins or 36 miniature muffins, baking time adjusted. It could be doubled and baked in a well-greased and floured bundt pan, baking time adjusted. This recipe could also be baked in an 8-inch square or 9-inch round, to create a thin cake (approx. 1 1/2 inches tall), baking time adjusted.",

Preheat the oven to 350 F. Line your baking dish (2 quart) with parchment paper, or grease well. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir occasionally until the foam starts turning golden and the mixture smells nutty. Remove from heat and pour immediately into a mixing bowl. Stir in the brown sugar and cream cheese. Beat for about 2 minutes, until slightly fluffy. Add the vanilla, then the eggs. Beat well, scraping the sides. Add the 2 cups of flour but dont mix it in. Use a small spoon to stir the baking soda and salt into the flour, then mix the flour into the batter. Stir until just combined. Add the 1/4 cup Nutella and swirl it with a rubber spatula. Dont stir it in all the way, leave some streaks. Pour into the prepared 2-quart pan, spreading to the edges. Remove the Nutella from the freezer. Use your fingers to push each dollop of Nutella into the dough. Distribute them evenly. Smooth the dough over the Nutella with a spatula. Bake for 27-30 minutes, until golden brown on top.

In a separate bowl add the milk and chocolate chips. Microwave in 30 second intervals stirring after each cycle until its melted. Mine is usually melted and ready to go after 3 cycles (1 minute 30 seconds). Its time to assemble! You can use a pie plate, large bowl, glass pan, small bowls, etc. I used 4 stemless glasses to match my banana pudding. Start with a layer of crumbled graham crackers. Then add some of the peanut butter mixture Then chocolate ganache Then some whipped topping (if you want) Then keep going with the crumbled graham crackers, peanut butter mixture and chocolate ganache until you run out of the peanut butter filling. Top with whipped topping and a graham cracker (I think crumbled peanut butter cups would look yummy on top) and youre done! Cover with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator.

        "Cooking_Steps": "1. Prepare the cheesecake layer: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place a large roasting pan on the lower third rack of the oven. Place a kettle of water on the stove to boil. Spray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick spray and line the bottom with a round of parchment paper. Wrap a double layer of foil around the bottom and up the sides of the pan (you want to seal it so the water from the water bath doesnt seep into the pan). In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to mix the cream cheese- blend until it is nice and smooth and creamy. Mix in sugar and salt and blend for 2 minutes, scraping down sides of the bowl as needed. Add eggs, one at a time, blending after each addition. Finally, mix in sour cream, whipping cream and vanilla. Mix until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Set the pan into the roasting pan in the pre-heated oven. Carefully pour the hot water from your kettle into the roasting pan (it will fill the pan surrounding the cheesecake). Pour enough water so that there is about an inch of water coming up the foil along the sides of the cheesecake pan. Bake the cheesecake for 45 minutes. It should be set to the touch and not jiggly. Remove the cheesecake from the roasting pan and let it cool on a wire rack for at least an hour. When it has cooled, place the pan into the freezer and let the cheesecake freeze completely. This can be done in several hours- or overnight. 2. Prepare the cake layers: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9-inch round metal baking pans (or spray with nonstick baking spray with flour). In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Add eggs, oil, buttermilk, food coloring, vanilla and vinegar to the flour mixture. Using an electric mixer on medium-low speed, beat for 1 minute, until blended. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl with a rubber spatula. Beat on high speed for 2 minutes. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pans, dividing equally. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached. Let cool in pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the pans, then invert cakes onto a rack to cool completely. 3. Prepare the frosting: In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat powdered sugar, cream cheese, butter and vanilla until it is smooth and creamy (do not overbeat). 4. Assemble the cake: Place one cake layer into the center of a cake plate or platter. Remove the cheesecake from the freezer, take off the sides of the pan, and slide a knife under the parchment to remove the cheesecake from the pan. Peel off the parchment. Measure your cheesecake layer against the cake layers. If the cheesecake layer turns out to be a slightly larger round than your cake, move it to a cutting board and gently shave off some of the exterior of the cheesecake to get it to the same size as your cake layers. Place the cheesecake layer on top of the first cake layer. Place the 2nd cake layer on top of the cheesecake. 5. Frost the cake: Apply a crumb coat layer to the cake- use a long, thin spatula to cover the cake completely with a thin and even layer of frosting. Be sure to wipe off your spatula each time you are about to dip it back into the bowl to get more frosting (this way you wont be transferring any red crumbs into the bowl of frosting). Dont worry at this point about the crumbs being visible in the frosting on the cake. When your cake has a thin layer of frosting all over it, place it into the refrigerator for 30 minutes to \"set\" the frosting. Once the first layer of frosting is set, apply the 2nd layer. Start by adding a large scoop of frosting onto the top of the cake. Use a long, thin spatula to spread the frosting evenly across the top and then spread it down the sides of the cake too. Because you applied a crumb-coat layer, you shouldnt have any red crumbs floating around in the final frosting layer. Decorate, as desired. I recommend white chocolate shavings (see *Tips below). Keep this cake refrigerated. Tips: *For making white chocolate shavings: Purchase a hunk of white chocolate. Microwave the chocolate to soften it up slightly (15 to 30 seconds, depending on the size). Use a potato peeler to run down the side of the chocolate to create shards/shaves/curls of white chocolate. I like to shave it onto a paper plater and then just use the plate to slide the chocolate onto the top of the cake. *If you are serving this cake at a party, its perfectly okay to leave the cake at room temperature for an hour or so while serving. Otherwise, keep it in the refrigerator. It also freezes perfectly! I made my cake one day and then just placed it as-is in the freezer and pulled it out the next day. It thaws quickly. more at recipegirl.com",

        "Cooking_Steps": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9 X 13 inch pan with a double layer of foil, leaving enough foil hang over the edge so youll be able to grab onto it to lift the brownies out of the pan later. Spray foil lightly with cooking spray. In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Add the sugar and stir to combine. Return the mixture to the heat briefly, just till its hot, but not bubbling; itll become shiny looking as you stir it. Heat the butter and sugar a second time will dissolve more of the sugar, which will yield a shiny top crust on your brownies. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl. Stir in the cocoa, salt, baking powder and vanilla, Add the eggs, beating till smooth: then add the flour and chocolate chips, beating will well combined. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan. Bake the brownies for 28 to 30 minutes, (this took more like 35 minutes for me) until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out dry (though it may have a few crumbs clinging to it). The brownies should feel set both on the edges, and in the center. Remove them from the oven, and after 5 minutes loosen the edges with a table knife; this helps prevent the brownies from sinking in the center as they cool. When brownies have cooled, lift them out of the pan by grabbing on to both ends of the foil. Lay foiled brownies on a flat surface. With a biscuit cutter or deep cookie cutter, cut out rounds of brownie and place on a cooling rack that has been placed over a sheet of wax paper. In double boiler, melt about 18 ounces of chocolate chips plus a tablespoon or so of shortening until smooth. Drop a tablespoon of the melted chocolate on top of each mini-brownie and allow it to flow over the sides. Smooth sides with a knife. Set aside to cool. I put mine in the freezer for a few minutes. Meanwhile combine about 6 ounces of caramel bits with a couple of tablespoons of heavy cream in a microwave dish. Microwave in 30 second increments until caramel is melted and smooth. Drizzle caramel over brownies. Top each brownie with a pecan half. Check out more at othersideoffifty.com :)",

Spoon 1/2 cup of turkey fat back into the pan (substitute butter if you dont have enough turkey fat). Whisk flour and cornstarch into fat. Cook, whisking, until flour is deeply browned and has a nutty aroma. Whisking constantly, pour the turkey stock and 1 cup reserved turkey juices into the pan. Whisk 1 minute, then use a wooden spoon to dislodge the browned bits from the bottom of the roasting pan. Resume whisking until gravy is smooth, then turn heat to high and bring to a boil. Boil until gravy is thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon, 3 to 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour through a fine strainer into a gravy boat and serve immediately.

I generally start with 1 TBSP, then shake some more on depending how much I can see in the mixture. Add cilantro. You can use a little or a lot, but this is what sells the salsa. Using mostly the leafy part, chop the cilantro and combine. Ill use the majority of one bunch, then save the rest for the other mexican dishes Im cooking. Add lemon/lime juice. Suggested is 1 TBSP. Always to taste, but is needed for yumminess. If you have the fake lemon or lime container in the fridge, squirt it around the bowl for 2-4 passes. If you have fresh fruit, roll the lemon/lime on the table while pushing down with your palm. This will help release the juice from the fruit. Cut in half and squeeze onto the salsa, without dropping the seeds in. Ill use one fresh lemon and one fresh lime. Stir. Refridgerate for at least 2 hours before serving.

I might puree the tomatoes.)",
        "Cooking_Steps": "Trim as much fat as you can from roast, and cut if necessary to fit into Crockpot. Rub meat well with steak seasoning and black pepper. Heat heavy pan with small amount of olive oil and brown roast well on both sides. This will take a few minutes; dont rush the browning step. While roast browns put 1 cup beef stock in saucepan, bring to a boil and cook until reduced to 1/2 cup, then let cool slightly and mix in balsamic vinegar and tomato sauce. Peel onions and cut into thick slices. Deglaze pan with 1/4 cup water and add to sauce mixture. (You can stop at this point and refrigerate browned roast, cut onions and mixed sauce ingredients and then put them in the Crockpot when you go to work in the morning. Dont refrigerate them in the crockery liner. Having the meat start out cold will add several hours to the cooking time, which will be good if youre cooking it all day while youre away.) Place onions in bottom of Crockpot. Put meat on top of onions and pour beef stock mixture over. Set Crockpot to low and cook 6-8 hours, until beef is tender. The meat might be partly submerged in liquid after this much time. (If I am home, I might turn the meat once or twice. Remove meat from crockpot and cover with foil to keep warm. Drain liquid from Crockpot and remove as much of the fat as you can with fat separator or skimmer. Cook down liquid by about 1/3, and serve sauce with meat and onions. submitted by KalynsKitchen - much more here!",

All you need is some tortillas and cooking spray. We used some small, soft \u201ctaco\u201d tortillas. We used the flour kind but corn is fine too. First you want to steam them\u2026 Wet some paper towels and wring them out well. Layer the tortillas with the wet paper towels on a plate and then microwave (we did 6 at a time). Keep an eye on them, it should be about 30 seconds until they are steamed. Then lightly spray each side with cooking spray and drape each tortilla over two bars of the oven rack. It is wise to put a baking sheet below them to catch any oil from the cooking spray. Bake at 350-375 degrees for 7-10 minutes. You will be able to tell that they are browning &amp; getting crispy. Take them out and set them aside! Okay, now for the filling All you need is ground beef (2 pounds), 1 can of refried beans, 1 can of tomato sauce, 1 packet of taco seasoning, shredded cheese, &amp; your favorite taco toppings. Brown the ground beef in a large skillet. COMPLETELY drain all grease and return to skillet. Over low heat, add refried beans, taco seasoning, and about half to two-thirds of the tomato sauce (you can eye this to see whats best, you don\u2019t want the filling to be too runny or your tacos will be soggy on the bottoms). Blend well and scoop into the tacos (which should be \u201cstanding\u201d in a lightly greased casserole type dish). Then just sprinkle the cheese over the top and bake.

        "Cooking_Steps": "Prepare the Beef: In a small bowl, make a rub by combining the salt, pepper and cayenne. Slice the roast into 4 equal sized pieces and remove any excess fat or gristle. Rub the meat on all sides with the salt mixture then wrap each piece tightly in plastic wrap. Place the meat on a plate and allow to sit overnight in the refrigerator. Place the Roast in a Slow Cooker on LOW for 6-8 hours. Meanwhile, make the Blue Cheese Coleslaw: In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, celery salt, Kosher salt and pepper. Pour enough of the mayonnaise dressing over the shredded cabbages and grated carrots to moisten them. Add in the crumbled blue cheese and chopped parsley and toss well to combine. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to combine. Make the Barbecue Sauce: Combine the onion and reserved fat in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally until the onion has softened, about 10 minutes. Add the minced garlic and chili powder and cook, stirring constantly until well combined and aromatic, about 30 seconds. Stir in remaining sauce ingredients and reserved juices and simmer until thickened, about 15-20 minutes. Allow the sauce to cool slightly before straining the sauce if you prefer a velvety texture. Assemble the Sandwiches: Split and lightly toast each hamburger bun. Using 2 forks, pull the beef apart into shreds, discarding any excess fat or gristle. In a saucepan set over low heat, toss the beef with enough barbecue sauce to moisten the meat well. When heated through, place the sauced beef on top of the bottom half of each bun. Top the beef with some of the blue cheese coleslaw, add the top half of the bun and serve immediately. from KookMeNow - more here!",

        "Cooking_Steps": "You\u2019ll want to get your sauce started first. It takes a little while for it to reduce and develop flavor. Heat a large saucepan under medium high heat and melt the butter. Add the carrot, celery, onion, and country ham. Do not skip the country ham. I think it really gives the sauce a depth of flavor that you don\u2019t get with just plain mirepoix. However, do watch your salt \u2013 since the ham is cured, it\u2019s pretty salty to begin with, so you may not even have to season with any additional (I didn\u2019t). Cook the vegetables until they are starting to become tender and the onions are translucent. Stir in the flour to make a roux. Cook roux for about 10 minutes, or until it begins a nice nutty brown color. Slowly stir in your beef stock, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Add tomato paste, parsley stems, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Leave partially covered and simmer for at least an hour to develop flavors. Skim off any fat or scum as you see fit. When the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, strain the liquid of the solids. Season to taste and keep warm until ready to use. While your sauce is simmering, you can caramelize your onions and cook your bacon. Melt the butter in a large saute pan under medium heat. Add onions and cook under low to medium heat until caramelized and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Don\u2019t rush the onions, the slower they cook, the sweeter and tastier they\u2019ll be. You don\u2019t want any browning, so be sure to stir them every so often. Place onions in a medium bowl to cool. Heat a small skillet under medium heat and add your strips of bacon. Cook until crisp, then remove with a slotted spoon, transferring to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. When bacon is dry, add in with onions. Reserve about 3 tablespoons of the rendered bacon fat from the pan. Add shredded cheese to bowl with onions and bacon and mix well. Taste for seasoning. Place the flank steak horizontally in front of you (so that it is widest). Spread the mustard atop the steak. Place an even layer of the filling over top of the mustard. Roll the steak up, like a jelly roll, keeping it as tight as possible. Cut in half and tie each roulade like a roast with some kitchen twine. Season the roulade with salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 425 F. Heat a large oven-proof skillet under medium high heat and add reserved bacon fat. Add the roulades and cook until all sides are golden brown and caramelized. Transfer the pan to the even to finish cooking, about 15-20 minutes, depending on your desired doneness. Let roulades rest for at least 5 minutes before removing kitchen twine and slicing. Remove kitchen twine with kitchen scissors and cut roulades into 1/2 inch slices. Serve atop sauce brune and with desired vegetable or starch.",

        "Cooking_Steps": "Preheat the oven to 275\u00baF. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and allow it to warm slightly as you prepare the butter herb mix (5 minutes or so). In a small bowl, stir together the butter, minced garlic, basil, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Rosemary pieces can be quite large, so either chop or crumble the dried pieces with your hands before adding them to the mix. Place the chicken on a cutting board and pat it dry on both sides with a clean paper towel. Smear the butter herb mixture over both sides of the chicken. Drying the meat will help the butter herb mixture stick. If the meat is too cold, it will form condensation as you rub the butter mixture over the surface and the butter will not stick. Place the seasoned chicken pieces in a casserole dish that is deep enough to fully contain the chicken. Cover tightly with foil, or with the dishs lid if there is one. Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 90 minutes, basting once half way through. Ater 90 minutes, remove the foil, baste again, and adjust the ovens temperature to 425\u00baF. Bake the chicken at 425\u00baF for 20 minutes without the foil, or until the skin is deep golden brown and crispy. Remove the chicken from the oven and let rest for 5-10 minutes.

Add Worcestershire sauce and chicken broth and mix well to combine. Cook until most of the liquid has cooked out (evaporated). I dont have much liquid in my pan after I combine all these, but it will depend on how well you drained your spinach. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature. 4- In a large bowl, combine the turkey, bread crumbs, and egg. Add cooled onion/spinach mixture to the meat. I do all of this step with my hands, but you can use a spoon if you prefer. 5- With your hands, create meatballs that are about 1 - 1 1/2 inches in diameter and place them on the baking sheet. Leave a little bit of space between each meatball. When you are done shaping your meatballs, you will probably have about 40-42 meatballs from this recipe. Dont need that many? Freeze them after baking or cut this recipe in half (but I say freeze them and then youve done the work only once and have a future meal). 6- Bake until your meatballs are cooked through with an internal temperature of 160 degrees F - which was about 20 minutes for my oven.

        "Cooking_Steps": "Prep the chicken: Cut the chicken into 8 pieces and pound the pieces until they are thin (for quick cooking) and have expanded in surface area (for more filling). Place the breadcrumbs in a shallow bowl with 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese and set aside. Prep the filling: Chop the spinach and saute it with the garlic and just a drizzle of olive oil for 2-3 minutes or until just barely wilted. Combine the sauteed spinach with the ricotta, Parmesan cheese, and 2-3 tablespoons of the egg whites. Place the remaining egg whites in a separate shallow bowl and set aside. Assemble the chicken: Oil the bottom of a large baking dish and preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place one piece of chicken on a flat working surface. Put a spoonful of ricotta-spinach filling right in the middle and roll the chicken up so that the edges meet to form a \"seam\". Dip the entire chicken roll in egg whites, and then roll it in the breadcrumbs. Place in a baking dish, seam side down. Repeat for the remaining 7 pieces of chicken. Bake for 25 minutes. Finishing touches: After 25 minutes, the chicken should be cooked through (white on the inside) and browned on the top. Cover the chicken with the marinara sauce and slices of fresh Mozzarella. Bake for another 3-5 minutes or until cheese is melting. Sprinkle with fresh basil. much more at http://www.cookglee.com/2013/07/baked-mozzarella-chicken-rolls.html",

Spread a good layer of the mayonnaise mixture on top of each piece of chicken. Divide the mozzarella slices in half to create 8 slices, and add to the top of each piece of chicken. Roll the crescent dough around each piece of chicken and place on the prepared cookie sheet. Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in the microwave and brush over the tops of each crescent roll. Sprinkle each roll-up with the remaining grated Parmesan cheese. Bake for 14-15 minutes or until the roll-ups are golden brown.",

Working in batches of two, place the seasoned chicken breasts skin-side-down into the oil and sear, dont not touch or move for 6-8 minutes. Sprinkle with kosher salt and black pepper before turning and continue to cook for four more minutes. Remove to a clean plate and repeat with the two remaining chicken breasts. Return all the breasts back to the pan and place them in a preheated 350 degree oven for 15-20 minutes or until the internal temperature of your chicken is around 160 degrees. Remove the chicken to a clean plate to rest, and start with the pan sauce. Place the pan the chicken was in onto the stove top and heat over medium high heat. Add in the minced shallot and cook until soft and translucent, 3-5 minutes. Add in the minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes. Pour in the cup of chicken stock and add the thyme and rosemary sprigs, bring to a simmer for 5-8 minutes. Remove the herbs and whisk in the tablespoon of butter.

In a separate bowl, combine the remaining 3 tablespoons soy sauce, and 2 tablespoons rice wine with the rice vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil and set aside. Heat the oil in a wok over high heat until its hot and barely smoking. Add the peanuts and toss them for about 2 minutes, or until they begin to brown. Remove the peanuts from the oil and transfer them to a heatproof plate. Set aside. Add the chicken to the oil and toss, cooking until it is slightly browned on the outside, but not cooked all the way through, about 2 minutes. Remove the chicken from the wok and add it to the peanuts. (There will be some brown bits on the bottom of the wok. They will help thicken the sauce when it is added to the pan later. Be careful and dont let them burn, or your sauce will taste sharp.). Add the chiles to the wok and cook them until they turn almost black, about 1 minute. Add the garlic, green onions, and ginger along with the peanuts, chicken, and the Sauce you set aside earlier. Toss to incorporate the sauce and heat through. Serve with rice. Variation: Sometimes we like to add vegetables to this dish to make it a one-dish meal. Try adding sliced water chestnuts and green or red bell peppers, brocolli, or bok choy along with the other vegetables in the dish. By swapping out the peanuts for cashews, the dish becomes cashew chicken. You can also vary the dish by using thinly sliced pork or beef, or whole shrimp. >",

Cook for a few minutes. If it gets too dry, add water to get the right consistency. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Mix the cheese and coriander into the chicken mixture. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll out to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut out rounds of the size you want (I used 4 inch cutters). Place about a tablespoon (or appropriate for your size) of the filling a bit off center and spread to the edges leaving a 1/4 inch border. Brush the border with egg whites (which act as a natural adhesive, I learnt this from making Cannolis). Fold the dough over the filling and press the edges to seal. You can use a fork to make groove marks on the edges. Freeze the filled empanadas for 10-15 minutes. This is a trick I picked up making tart dough. It lets the butter firm up again ensuring there is no shrinkage and in this case allows the gluing process to complete, so there is no disaster in the oven. Preheat oven to 400F and baked the empanadas for 20-25 minutes until golden brown and flaky. Cool for just a few minutes and serve immediately.",

        "Ingredients": "2 lbs thick cut bacon 2 lbs Italian sausage 3/4 cup barbecue sauce (your favorite) 3 tablespoons barbecue seasoning (your favorite rub, recommended Bad Byrons Butt Rub, Rendezvous Famous Seasoning, or Steven Raichlen)",
        "Cooking_Steps": "1 To kick off the construction of this pork medley youll need to create a 5x5 bacon weave. If the strips youre using arent wide enough to span 5x5 inches, then you may need to use a few extra slices to fill out the pattern. Just make sure your weave is tight and that you end up with a nice square shape to work with. 2 The next step is to add some barbecue seasoning on top of your bacon weave. (BBQ Addict recommends Bad Byrons Butt Rub, Rendezvous Famous Seasoning, or Steven Raichlens All-Purpose Rub). 3 Now that youre pork is well seasoned, its time to add more pork. Take two pounds of Italian sausage and layer it directly on top of your bacon weave. Be sure to press the sausage to the outer edges of the bacon creating a patty that is the same thickness all the way across. Most grocery stores carry loose sausage, so just pick out one you like. 4 Next up is bacon layer number two. Take the remaining bacon slices and fry them up the same way you would for breakfast. If you like soft bacon, make it soft. If you like crunchy bacon, make it crunchy. 5 Since this is a barbecue recipe, we need to add another layer of barbecue flavor. Take your favorite sauce and drizzle it all over the top of the bacon pieces. (BBQ Addict recommends Burnt Finger BBQs homemade competition sauce). Once youve sauced the bacon, sprinkle on some more of the barbecue seasoning you used on the bacon weave. 6 Very carefully separate the front edge of the sausage layer from the bacon weave and begin rolling backwards. You want to include all layers EXCEPT the bacon weave in your roll. Try and keep the sausage as tight as possible and be sure to release any air pockets that may have formed. Once the sausage is fully rolled up, pinch together the seams and ends to seal all of the bacon goodness inside. 7 At this point we can start to see the final shape of our Bacon Explosion, but were missing one key item. To complete the construction process, roll the sausage forward completely wrapping it in the bacon weave. Make sure it sits with the seam facing downward to help keep it all sealed up. 8 Sprinkle some barbecue seasoning on the outside of the bacon weave, and now it is ready for the smoker. Cook your Bacon Explosion at 225\u00c2\u00b0F in a constant cloud of hickory smoke until your meat thermometer gives an internal temperature reading of 165\u00c2\u00b0F Normally this will take about 1 hour for each inch of thickness, but that could vary depending on how well you maintain your fire and also how many times you open the smoker to take a peek. BBQ Addict recommends 2.5 hours, for a roll 2.5 inches in diameter. 9 Now that the Bacon Explosion is fully cooked, you need to add some finishing flavors. Remember that barbecue sauce you used for inner flavor? Youll be using that same sauce to glaze the cooked bacon weave. Using a basting brush, coat the entire surface with a thin layer of sauce. Sweet sauces are loaded with sugars, so theyll give your fatty a nice glossy finish. Spicy and vinegar based sauces dont contain as much, so they wont set up as well. If youre dead set on using those sauces, just cut them with a bit of honey and youll get the same effect. 10 Slice the Bacon Explosion into quarter to half inch rounds to serve. If your roll was good and tight, you should now see a nice bacon pinwheel pattern throughout the sausage.",

When everything is well-combined, add the shrimp, squeeze as much air as possible out of the bag, and close it up. Place it in the fridge. 2.) Let the shrimp marinate for 30-60 minutes, flipping the bag around once or twice during that time, so that all the shrimp stay evenly covered in the marinade. 3.) When youre ready to cook, take the shrimp out of the fridge and let them sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; there is no need to add any oil or butter to the pan, as the marinade has enough oil in it to keep the shrimp from sticking to the pan. (If you would prefer to use the grill for these, you can thread them onto skewers and toss them on the grill at this point.) 4.) Add your shrimp to the pan in a single layer, making sure they are not too crowded; you can always cook them in more than one batch. Let them cook on one side for about a minute, until they curl up and start to turn pink. Flip them over, and cook for another 30 seconds or so, until the shrimp are opaque.

When the scallops are almost cooked add the chopped roasted garlic, stir allowing the garlic to break apart. Add the white wine and then return the prosciutto. Drop the al dente pasta into the saut\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9 pan and toss with the sauce. If you need more liquid in your sauce add some pasta water. Salt to taste and add lots of fresh ground black pepper, enough to give a bit of kick. Plate with the fresh basil sprinkled on top, if you enjoy fresh basil this is a great recipe to go crazy and double the portion.",

You can either skewer the shrimp, or place them directly on the grill. Personally, I skewer them. Its way too much work flipping the shrimp individually, and youre bound to get a few burned that way. Shrimp cook quickly, so you\u2019re going to want to take them off as soon as they lose their translucent appearance and turn pinkish. This should take about 5 or 6 minutes per side on a medium hot grill. I typically turn them often to keep from burning them. much more at http://www.smokedngrilled.com/lemon-spice-grilled-shrimp/",

Cover tightly with foil and bake for 5 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake until the bottoms of the potatoes are spotty golden brown, 15-20 minutes, rotating the baking sheet after 10 minutes. Using a metal spatula and tongs, flip each potato wedge keeping them in a single layer. Continue baking until the fries are golden and crisp, 5 -15 minutes.

In a bowl mix the liquid ingredients and spices, so the buttermilk, eggs, paprika, hot sauce, salt and pepper and mix really well. In another bowl, combine the baking powder and baking soda, and then whisk into the buttermilk until it becomes foamy. In a shallow dish add the flour alongside the buttermilk mixture. First dredge the chicken in the flour on all sides, then dip into the buttermilk mixture and make sure its coated well all around. Dredge the chicken in flour one more time, then place the chicken on a plate, and repeat with all chicken pieces. So its easy, flour, buttermilk, flour. If your flour gets too dirty just throw it out and start with fresh flour. In a frying pan, heat lots of oil, at least an inch. Make sure the oil is hot enough. Do not put too many pieces at once, leave enough room in between the chicken, because you dont want them to stick together. Also if you put too many chicken pieces, the chicken might not cook all the way through. The first side will take longer to cook maybe about 7 min, and the second side will cook faster, 3 to 5 minutes, so be patient and let the chicken cook properly. Repeat with remaining chicken. After the chicken is fried, place them on paper towels to soak up some of the oil and sprinkle some salt over it.",

        "Recipe_Name": "Spicy Fried Chicken",
        "Ingredients": "Chicken 1 Large Chicken (3-4lbs), Vegetable Oil (for frying), 1/2 Cup of Butter (for frying), For the Tabasco Brine 2 quarts (liters) of water, 1/4 cup kosher salt, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2 tbsp honey or maple syrup, 3 tbsp black peppercorns, 8 cloves thinly sliced garlic, 1 large onion, thinly sliced, 1/2 cup Tabasco sauce (add more if you like), For the flour and spice dredge 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper, 3 heaping tbsp smoked paprika, 2 tbsp Chili Powder (optional),",
        "Cooking_Steps": "Prepare the brine by adding the water, kosher salt, brown sugar and honey to a large plastic or glass bowl. Stir until the salt and sugar are dissolved then add the peppercorns, garlic, onion and Tabasco Sauce. Drop the chicken pieces into the brining liquid , cover and refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours. If you need to add a little more water to completely cover the chicken, thats not a problem. After 24 - 48 hours, remove the chicken from the brine mixture. Pat dry with paper towels. To make the flour and spice dredge simply toss the flour, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika together until completely blended. Add the brined chicken pieces to the flour dredge. Toss well and press the chicken pieces into the flour dredge with your palms to get good contact with the meat. Let stand for ten minutes, then toss again and press down with your palms again. This ensures a good crust on the chicken. Now its time to warm up your oil and butter. In a 12 inch cast iron skillet heat 1 inch canola or corn oil with \u00bd cup real dairy butter until it reaches 35O degrees F. Just below medium heat works well on my stove but use a thermometer to be sure. A cast iron skillet is the best for fried chicken. Be extra careful to regulate the heat properly of using anything other than cast iron. Even cooking is essential. Drop the dredged chicken pieces into the hot oil/butter mix and cook for approximately 35- 40 minutes depending on the size of your chicken pieces, turning at least once halfway through the cooking time. I start with the dark meat pieces and add the breasts about 10-15 minutes into the cooking time because these will cook faster. I always use my meat thermometer to ensure that the largest pieces have reached an internal temperature of 175 degrees F, which is perfect for fried chicken. The chicken should be a beautiful golden brown when it comes out of the oil. Let it rest on a wire rack to drain for 10 minutes before serving.",

Generally, I find rice vinegar less strong than regular white vinegar). 3. Reduce heat to low and add the cornstarch-water mixture. Stir to incorporate and continue stirring occasionally until the sauce thickens (about 2 minutes). 4. Remove from heat and taste-test. You should taste \"sweet\" first, followed by sour, then spicy and salty notes. If the sauce isnt sweet enough, add a little more sugar. If not spicy enough, add more chili. 5. Pour sauce into a small bowl or jar and serve as a condiment with chicken, fish, and seafood, or as a dip with finger foods such as chicken wings, shrimp, or spring rolls. Also makes an excellent marinade for grilled chicken, fish, or seafood. ENJOY!

Using spatula, mix the onions, scraping the bottom of the pan and coating onions with a pinch of balsamic vinegar you just added. 2) While you\u2019re caramelizing the onions, cook bacon: I usually bake it in the oven at 350 until it just turns crispy. Drain the bacon on paper towels and chop into small pieces. 3) Cook elbow macaroni according to package instructions. Rinse the macaroni under cold running water, drain. Set aside. 4) In a large saucepan, add heavy cream, milk, sharp white cheddar cheese, Gruyere cheese and 1/4 teaspoon salt on medium heat, stir and mix, until cheeses start to blend. Add black pepper, Cayenne pepper and paprika to your taste, or omit them if you don\u2019t want them. Add elbow macaroni to the creamy sauce, stir to coat on low heat for about 5-10 minutes until cheeses melt completely and coat the macaroni. 6) Add caramelized onions and chopped bacon to the creamy macaroni. 7) Serve on warm plates (warmed in the oven) as is, or with more cheese (finely grated) sprinkled on top. much more at http://juliasalbum.com/macaroni-and-cheese-with-bacon-and-caramelized-onions-recipe/",

        "Cooking_Steps": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Pour the can of crushed tomatoes into a small bowl. Finely mince the garlic and toss in with the tomatoes (I like to use my microplane to do this since the garlic won\u2019t burn in the sauce and this way you won\u2019t get large chunks of raw garlic while you eat). Stir in the oregano, salt, sugar and pepper. Set aside. Prepare the rolls: Cut off just the very top crust of the roll. Use your fingers to pull out the bread from inside the roll, creating a bowl. Be careful not to pull too much off from close to the sides and bottom as you don\u2019t want the ingredients to leak out. You will want the sides and bottom to be about \u00bd-3/4\u201d thick. (Toast up the bread you pulled out to use as croutons in a soup or salad to avoid waste!) Heat the cooking oil in a saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saut\u00e9 for about 2-3 minutes or until tender. Add the ground beef to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Break up the meat as it cooks with a wooden spoon, stirring frequently until the meat is no longer pink. Remove from the heat and drain using a metal colander. Set aside. Place the \u201cbread bowls\u201d onto a baking sheet. Spread the bottom of each with a good portion of the sauce. Then divide the ground beef mixture among the rolls (you don\u2019t want these to over flow too much, so use less beef if necessary). Layer the mushrooms and the pepperoni on top of the beef. Now top the each bun with the mozzarella cheese. The mixture/cheese should come just barely above the top of the bun as it will sink a little as it cooks. Cook the deep dish pizzas for about 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbling, the bread is slightly toasted, and the ingredients are warmed through.

Have it on medium-high heat. -Add a splash of wine and stir until it\u2019s completely absorbed and the rice looks dry again. Or skip this step. -Then add about 2 C of hot stock. It should sizzle pretty loudly because the rice is dry and hot. Stir with a wooden spoon in circles, slowly and constantly. When the stock is almost completely absorbed, and a wooden spoon leaves a trail across the pan, add another 2 C stock. Keep stirring in circles. Repeat, until your rice is al dente (meaning it still has a touch of firmness to it). -The final texture should be creamy, with almost a very thick \u201csauce\u201d forming around the rice. This is just starch from the rice combined with stock. -Pull from the heat immediately and stir in another T of butter. Then immediately spread on a cookie sheet or hotel pan to cool.

        "Cooking_Steps": "In a large bowl, combine water, yeast, honey and olive oil. Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add in 2 1/2 cups flour, salt, garlic powder and dried basil, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but it still sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work the additional 1/2 cup flour (you dont need to use all if it is not needed) in to the dough, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1 1/2 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. Using a roll pin or your hands, form it into your desired shape (sometimes I use baking sheets and do rectangles or free form pizzas). Place the towel back over the dough and let sit in the warm place for 10 minutes. While the dough is rising again, melt 3 tablespoons of butter. Mix it with the garlic and 1 tablespoon of parmesan cheese. Bring the dough back out and using a spoon or pastry brush, douse the outside edges with the butter and garlic mixture. You can spread the butter all over, just make sure to focus on the edges. Use it all up! Continue to make your pizza with your desired toppings. Bake the pizza for 23-25 minutes (or longer if needed, depending on your toppings), or until crust and cheese are both golden. While pizza is baking, melt remaining butter and combine with the last tablespoon of parmesan. Remove pizza from over and immediately brush the outside edges with parmesan butter, using it all up. Sprinkle a bit of parmesan over top if desired. Serve! Note: I realize that if you buy yeast in the packets, it can be a pain to measure 3 teaspoons. If you dont want to do that, I suggest making a double recipe of this crust. However! I also prefer buying jars of yeast these days instead of packets, and just keeping it in the fridge, so I suggest doing that. more at howsweeteats.com",

Cook sauce, whisking occasionally, until sauce has thickened, about 6 minutes. Add cream cheese to sauce and whisk until cheese has melted. Let sauce continue to cook until pasta is ready. Before you drain the pasta, reserve a few ladlefuls of the pasta water (about 1/2 cup) and set aside. Once youve done that, transfer the pasta to a colander, drain the rest of the pasta water, and set the pasta aside while you finish the sauce. Stir parmesan cheese, shredded chicken, and spinach into sauce. Stir until cheese has melted.

You may not need all of the pasta water - use just enough so that the sauce reaches your desired consistency. Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper as necessary.

Pour the tomato/water mixture and the tomato sauce over the noodles (again, dont stir). Cover the pan and bring the liquid to a simmer. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook, now stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender (about 20 minutes). Turn off the heat under the pan. Stir in 1/2 cup of the Parmesan and season to taste with salt and pepper. Drop the ricotta by heaping spoonfuls onto the top of the lasagna (dont stir to incorporate), then cover and let stand for about 5 minutes to allow the cheese to soften. Remove the cover and sprinkle with the basil and remaining Parmesan, then serve.",

Peel and discard the sweet potato skin (or sprinkle it with a pinch of salt and much on it for a snack!). You can do this as much as a day ahead of time. Let the potato cool completely. 2. Place the sweet potato in a medium bowl and crush it with a fork until well mashed. Add the flours and salt. Knead the dough well, adding flour as necessary to allow for easy handling. Avoid adding more flour than necessary to keep the gnocchi from getting tough. 3. When you can easily handle the dough, separate it into four segments and roll each segment on a floured surface into long skinny ropes. Each roll should be approximately 3/4 of an inch in diameter. With a fork, cut each roll into 1/2 inch gnocchi segments. If you\u2019d like to make the traditional grooves in your gnocchi, press each piece of pasta lightly with the fork. You can store these in an airtight container in the fridge for 2\u20133 days. 4. When you\u2019re ready to cook your gnocchi, boil water just as you would normally for pasta. When the water is boiling, add a pinch of salt and the gnocchi. Keep the gnocchi simmering and stir them periodically to avoid sticking. When they float to the surface of the water, let them cook for another 5\u201310 minutes to taste. Strain the gnocchi from the water. The Sauce: Basically, just threw a large can of tomatoes (28 ounces \u2013 you can use the juice and tomatoes if you want it even lighter) and a few Tablespoons of basil to a blender.

Roll out pasta the dough should be paper-thin, about 1/8-inch thick (you should almost be able to see your hand through it). 5. Set aside while getting the filling ready. For the filling: 1. Place damp spinach leaves in a large skillet over medium heat. Cover with a lid and let the leaves wilt. Once wilted let cool and then chop. 2. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a small skillet. Add the onion and cook over medium heat, until translucent. Stir in the spinach and salt to taste. Cook for about one minute. 3. Transfer the spinach mixture to a medium bowl. Stir in ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, mozzarella, and the egg yolk. Mix well and set aside. 4. Lay out your long sheets of pasta on a lightly floured table. Place small balls of filling, about 1 teaspoon, in a line about one inch from the bottom of the pasta sheet. Leave about 1 1/4 inches between each ball of filling. Fold over the top of the pasta sheet, lining it with the bottom edge. Seal the bottom and 2 open sides with your finger. Use a ravioli cutter to cut out the individual raviolis. Place the ravioli on a large plate. 5. Boil a huge pot of water with salt. Add in the ravioli and cook for about 5-6 minutes. Strain and serve with the sauce of your choice. .: Side Notes :. If you have a Kitchen Aid Mixer you can use that to mix the pasta dough just make sure to use the hook attachment and keep the speed on low Feel free to add any herbs you like to the filling, when I want to change things up I normally add a little basil, rosemary or whatever else I have on hand.",

Put your pizza dough into the pan and lightly press it to fit the bottom and up the sides of the skillet. Let rest a few minutes and finish spreading as the dough is very elastic. Assemble your toppings, by making your pizza upside down. By this i mean add about half of your cheeses first, then your veggies, then the meats, then add your sauce over the top and the rest of your cheese on top. This will help prevent it from getting soggy on the bottom and the sauce will go through all the toppings as well.

Spread one of the doughs in a 26 cm pizza pan and let it rise for 50 minutes. (or you can make a small circle and throw it in the air until you get the size of pizza you want :) ) If you have another pan you can do both at the same time. If you dont have a breadmaker, add the ingredients as written in a bowl and make a dough until it doesnt stick in your hands. (its important that the salt doesnt touch the yeast, otherwise it wont rise). Once your dough is done, you have to knead it as much as you can, for around 10 to 15 minutes (you can throw it over the table with all your might several times :) ) Spread some olive oil to your pizza pans so it doesnt stick and also gives the pizza that awesome flavor! Once your dough is done, make two balls with it and spread it in your pizza pans. Let it rise for 50 minutes. Meanwhile prepare your tomato sauce: Grab a skillet, add oil to it, then add onion and garlic. Let it cook for a couple of minutes and then add tomato sauce. Add your spices, let it cook for 5 minutes and its done. Once your dough has risen, lightly add some of your tomato sauce all over the dough and put it in the oven until the crust is crispy (400 F) Once its cooked, take it out, add the toppings and again put in the oven until the cheese is melted. The second dough you can add other toppings or you can cook it with the sauce and then freeze it until you are ready to use it. Enjoy!

To freeze the quesadillas, simply fill each one and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place in the freezer for one hour to solidify the quesadillas and then transfer to a freezer bag. To reheat either microwave (for a soft quesadilla) or cook in a skillet on low heat (make sure to use low heat so that the filling has time to thaw and melt before the outside burns).",

        "Cooking_Steps": "Shape your loaf of bread: Shape your loaf into a round or a loaf depending on the size of your slow cooker and/or what kind of loaf youd like to make. Set the shaped dough on a square of parchment paper. (If youre baking the bread in a pan, theres no need to use parchment.) Lift it into the slow cooker: Lift the loaf by the parchment and set it in the middle of the slow cooker. Try to arrange flatten the parchment as much as possible against the sides of the slow cooker to prevent it from getting caught in the bread as it rises. Cover the slow cooker with its lid. \u2192 Pre-Baking Rise?You do not need to let your bread rise before baking. However, if your bread dough has been in the refrigerator, letting it warm a bit on the counter can reduce the overall cooking time. Set the slow cooker to HIGH: Turn on your slow cooker to the highest heat setting (or quickest time setting). Bake for 1 to 2 1/2 hours: Baking time will vary depending on your slow cooker. If this is your first time baking bread in your slow cooker, begin checking the loaf after 1 hour, then every 30 minutes, and then more frequently as it nears finishing. Record this baking time for future reference. Bread is done with an internal temperature of 190\u00b0F to 200\u00b0F: Checking the internal temperature of the loaf is the best way to tell when it is done baking; a finished loaf will have an internal temperature of 190\u00b0F to 200\u00b0F. The top will also feel soft but no longer spongy, and the bottom will be hard and slightly golden. Brown the loaf under the broiler: If a darker-colored, crustier loaf is desired, set the loaf on a rack positioned in the middle of the oven and turn on the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes. Check frequently to avoid burning the loaf. Cool and slice: Let the loaf cool completely on a wire rack before slicing. submitted by Kitchn - much more here!",

        "Cooking_Steps": "Combine the flour and shortening in a large mixing bowl and work the shortening into the flour with your fingers until completely incorporated. If this isnt done thoroughly (until no particles of shortening remain visible), the tortillas will have an irregular texture.

If all the dry ingredients havent been dampened, add the rest of the liquid (plus a little more, if necessary). Scoop the dough onto your work surface and knead until smooth. It should be a medium-stiff consistency not firm, but not quite as soft as most bread dough either. Divide the dough into 12 portions and roll each into a ball. Set them on a plate, cover with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 30 minutes. This makes the dough easier to roll. Heat an ungreased griddle or heavy skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Flatten a ball of dough, flour it, then roll forward and back across it; rotate a sixth of a turn and roll forward and back again; continue rotating and rolling until you reach a 7-inch circle, lightly flouring the tortilla and work surface from time to time. Lay the tortilla on the hot griddle (you should hear a faint sizzle and see an almost immediate bubbling across the surface). After 30 to 45 seconds, when there are browned splotches underneath, flip it over. Bake 30 to 45 seconds more, until the other side is browned; dont over bake the tortilla or it will become crisp. Remove and wrap in a cloth napkin placed in a tortilla warmer. Roll and griddle-bake the remaining tortillas in the same manner stack them one on top of the other in the warmer.",

With floured hands and a floured rolling pin, roll out one portion of the dough at a time to about 1/4 inch thick. Fold the dough over to make it 1/2 inch thick. For each biscuit, dip a 1 to 1 1/4 inch biscuit cutter into reserved flour and cut out the biscuits, starting at the outside edge and cutting very close together, being careful not to twist the cutter. The scraps may be combined to make additional biscuits, although these scraps make tougher biscuits. Roll out the second portion when ready to bake. Using a metal spatula if necessary, move the biscuits to an ungreased baking sheet, placing the biscuits 1 inch apart. Refrigerate the biscuits for 10 to 20 minutes until cold. Bake the biscuits on the top rack of the oven for a total of 10 to 12 minutes until light golden brown. After 6 minutes, rotate the pan in the oven so that the front of the pan is now turned to the back, and check to see if the bottoms are browning too quickly. If so, slide another packing pan underneath to add insulation and retard the browning. Continue baking another 4 to 6 minutes until the biscuits are light golden brown. When the biscuits are done, lightly brush the tops with butter. Turn the biscuits out upside down on a plate to cool slightly. Serve hot, right side up. These biscuits may be frozen, unbaked or baked, and reheated. more at sandynawrot.com",

        "Cooking_Steps": "Place the rolls onto a cutting board, and using a sharp knife, cut each roll into quarters. Melt one stick of butter in the microwave (Yes... one whole stick lol) stir the melted butter and seasonings together until blended. Add the quartered rolls to the butter, and toss gently to coat. Bread dough is sticky, so, you may need to use your hands to gently pull the pieces apart if necessary. You dont want the dough to form clumps, or it will effect how it bakes. This is really the only way to mess-up this recipe....very important! Next, add 2/3 cup of grated Parmesan-Romano cheese reserving the rest for the top. Toss until each piece is coated. You can bake this bread in any shape you like, but, today, I chose a loaf pan. Layer the dough quarters evenly in a standard 9x3x2 inch loaf pan sprayed with cooking spray. The dough pieces naturally stick together due to the butter and cheese, but, gently pull apart any clumps of dough. We want to be certain the bread bakes evenly. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup of cheese on top and a sprinkle of parsley for color. Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap that has been sprayed with cooking spray. This will keep the bread from sticking to the plastic wrap as it rises. Allow to rise in a draft free, warm place for 2-2 1/2 hours. Then, remove the plastic wrap, and place into a 350\u00b0F preheated oven. Bake at 350\u00b0F for 18 minutes, then check the top. If baking in a loaf, you may need to lay a piece of aluminum foil over the top of the bread to prevent the cheese and butter on top from over browning while the inside of the loaf fully bakes. Continue to bake the bread for another 5-7 minutes, until the center is completely done. Approximately, 23-25 minutes total, depending on your oven. Test the center of the rolls using a cake tester, or toothpick to be certain the bread is cooked all the way through before removing it from the oven.

Dont wash the onion pan - youll use it to fry the latkes. While the onions are cooling, peel the potatoes. You can peel them by hand, with a vegetable peeler or with a knife. The skin will come off easily. Grate the potatoes into a large bowl, using the large holes in a hand or box grater. Theyre extremely easy to grate.

Form the latkes into any size you like by scooping with a tablespoon and using your hands to gently pat them into the desired shape. Lay each latke carefully into the hot oil after you form it, working in batches so you dont crowd the pan. Cook for about 2 minutes per side or until they are golden brown. Adjust the heat so they dont burn and add more oil, as needed. Transfer cooked latkes to a paper-towel-lined tray.

In the bowl of a standing mixture fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour, sugars, and salt on low speed. Turn off the mixer and pour the water/yeast mixture and melted butter into the bowl. Turn the mixer on and knead for 6 to 8 minutes until the dough is smooth. If the dough is too dry you can add extra water, a tablespoon at a time. Lightly oil a large bowl. Remove the dough from the mixer and shape into a ball. Place the dough ball in the bowl, cover with a clean towel, and allow to rise for one hour ( or until double in size ). Note:* I turn on my oven at the lowest temp at 200 while I am doing my food prep. Then I place the bowl in the oven, and turn off the oven with the door slightly open for 30 minutes, then remove it and place on top of the oven for the remainder of the rising time.* Towards the end of rising time, preheat oven to 450 degrees and prepare baking sheets with parchment paper and cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the hot water and baking soda. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg whites and melted butter. After the dough has risen, punch down the dough and then knead with hands for one minute. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and divide dough into 12 even portions. Now you can pick your shape. For pretzel bites roll each portion into a snake then cut the snake into bite size pieces, about 1 1/2 inches in width. Dip the pieces in the baking soda water and place on the baking sheet. Dab with a paper towel if there is an excess of water. Brush each pretzel bite with egg whites/melted butter mixture then sprinkle with kosher salt.

Knead with the dough hook on the mixer for 5 minutes or by hand for about 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Coat a large bowl with olive oil and place the dough in it. Cover with a towel and allow the dough to rise for one hour, or until doubled in size. Punch the dough down and divide in half. Allow it to rise a few more minutes while you thoroughly coat a large baking sheet with olive oil. Shape the dough into two round loaves and sprinkle the tops of the loaves with remaining chopped rosemary. Press the herbs lightly into the surface of the bread. Let the loaves rise again, until doubled in size, approximately 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove from the oven. Using a large spatula, transfer the loaves to a wire cooling rack. Brush with the remaining melted butter and sprinkle with crushed sea salt. The sea salt is a crucial step. You could probably substitute kosher salt, but whatever you do, do not skip the salt on top of the loaves. It imparts a great flavor to the finished bread. When you are ready to serve the bread, crack some black pepper onto a small plate and drizzle with olive oil. Dip the bread into the oil mixture and enjoy!",

        "Cooking_Steps": "Place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil for easier cleanup, if desired. Pull the leaves off of the cauliflower base. Cut off the lower part of the stem. Cut the head of cauliflower into four quarters. Slice each quarter into 6-8 pieces. You want as many flat surfaces as possible on each floret-- the flat surfaces caramelize best. Caramelization is the key to giving the roasted cauliflower flavor. Give all the florets a thorough rinse in a colander. Shake them dry. Spread out the cauliflower on your baking sheet or pan. Reserve any small bits of cauliflower that have fallen away from the florets in a small bowl. Drizzle the florets evenly with 1 tbsp olive oil. I use a measuring spoon of olive oil, which makes it easier to gauge how much oil Im using, rather than pouring straight from the bottle. Toss the florets to coat them fully with oil-- I use clean hands for this step. Sprinkle the cauliflower evenly with smoked paprika and salt to taste. Be generous with the salt-- smoked paprika really sings when its combined with salt. Place the baking sheet into the preheated oven and let the cauliflower roast for 10 minutes. While cauliflower is cooking, drizzle 1/4 tsp of olive oil into the small bowl of reserved cauliflower bits that have fallen away from the florets and toss to coat. Sprinkle them with smoked paprika and salt. You will add these to the sheet a little later so they wont burn. After 10 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Sprinkle the reserved cauliflower bits onto the baking sheet. Return the baking sheet to the oven. Let the cauliflower roast for 10-20 minutes longer till tender. When its ready you will be able to pierce it easily with a fork.

        "Cooking_Steps": "Wash and remove any sprouts or bad spots from the potatoes. If using thin-skinned potatoes(e.g. red, new, or Yukon gold potatoes), leave the skin on. If using thicker-skinned potatoes (e.g. Russet), peel them. Cut the potatoes into 3/4 inch dice. Place in a microwave-safe dish, add water to about 1-inch deep. Cover and microwave until the potatoes are almost done. Time varies depending on amount of potatoes and strength of microwave oven but takes about 10 minutes for 2 large servings. While the potatoes are cooking, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Chop the onions and saute in the melted butter, stirring occasionally to promote even cooking. When the potatoes are soft, much of the water will have been absorbed. Use a slotted spoon to add the potatoes to skillet with the onions, leaving as much water behind as possible. Let the potatoes saute for about 2 minutes to brown slightly on one side. Finely chop the parsley (and, optionally, zest the lemon). Add these to the skillet and toss to mix thoroughly. Allow this to heat through for about 2 minutes. Taste, and season with salt and pepper. While the potatoes are heating through, you have just enough time to heat some pre-cooked smoked sausage in the microwave. Offer a dollop of mustard with the sausage and dinner is served. from Heidi - JustaPinch - more here!",

I usually toss them one more time, then let them go for another 15 minutes, but it all depends on how big the pieces are.

Bring the water to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, and cook the potatoes until they are completely tender and can be easily pierced with a metal or wood skewer. Make sure they are cooked through but don\u2019t overcook. The total cooking time will be 30 to 35 minutes. While the potatoes are cooking, set up a double layer of clean dishtowels on your countertop. As the potatoes finish cooking, remove them individually from the water, and let them drain and sit for just a minute or two on the dishtowels. Flatten and cool the potatoes: Fold another dishtowel into quarters, and using it as a cover, gently press down on one potato with the palm of your hand to flatten it to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Repeat with all the potatoes. Don\u2019t worry if some break apart a bit; you can still use them. Cover a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil; put a sheet of parchment on top of the foil. Transfer the flattened potatoes carefully to the baking sheet and let them cool completely at room temperature. Roast the potatoes Remove the pan of potatoes from the refrigerator, if prepared ahead. Heat the oven to 450\u00b0F. Alternatively, if you have a convection function, turn it on and set the temperature at 400\u00b0F. Sprinkle the potatoes with about 3/4 tsp. salt and pour the olive oil over them. Lift the potatoes gently to make sure some of the oil goes underneath them and that they are well coated on both sides. Roast the potatoes until they\u2019re crispy and deep brown around the edges, about 30 minutes if using a convection oven, 30 to 40 minutes if roasting conventionally, turning over once gently with a spatula or tongs halfway through cooking.

While cooking, salt and pepper the potatoes to taste (they dont have to be too salty as the bacon with help with the saltiness as well) and sprinkle a light pinch of garlic powder. In another pan cook your bacon on medium heat to desired tenderness (I liked mine crispy for this sandwich!). While everything is cooking, slice your bread (use some crusty bread like french or sourdough if you have it), and generously butter the outside of each piece. On the inside, put about 1 tablespoon of sour cream on each slice as well as slices of cheddar cheese on each side. Once your potatoes and bacon are finished frying, dab them on paper towel to remove some grease, then fan the potatoes out on your bottom slice of bread, put a little more sour cream on top of the potatoes if you desire (I did to help the bacon and chives stick in the sandwich). Slice up one green onion stalk and spread it on top of the potatoes along with the bacon. Place your other slice of cheese on top of all of this and top with your bread! More at bsinthekitchen.com",

Once that is done, put everything in the pan (feel free to add more butter if you like) and cook until the broccoli gets to a nice dark green and the onions start to get translucent. Just before you take off the broccoli mixture, take two slices of chicken breast deli meat, shred it up and cook it in the pan for 30 seconds or so. The chicken is there to emphasize the flavour of chicken broth which would go into a broccoli and cheddar soup. The broccoli wanted to escape Once the broccoli is cooked, take your bread and generously butter the outside of each slice. On the bottom slice, place a slice of cheddar cheese , then the broccoli mixture on top. Top that off with another slice of cheddar cheese and your other slice of bread.

        "Ingredients": "3 cups peanut oil 1 egg 1 cup milk 1 cup flour 2 1/2 tablespoons powdered sugar 1/2 teaspoon pepper 2 tablespoons salt 2 Chicken Breasts, halved 4 hamburger buns 2 tablespoons melted butter 8 dill pickle slices",
        "Cooking_Steps": "1. Heat the peanut oil in a pressure cooker over medium heat to about 400 degrees. 2. In a small bowl, beat the egg and stir in the milk. 3. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, sugar, pepper, and salt. 4. Dip each piece of chicken in milk until it is fully moistened. 5. Roll the moistened chicken in the flour mixture until completely coated. 6. Drop all four chicken pieces into the hot oil and close the pressure cooker. When steam starts shooting through the pressure release, set the timer for 3 1/2 minutes. 7. While the chicken is cooking, spread a coating of melted butter on the face of each bun. 8. When the chicken is done, reomove it from the oil and drain or blot on paper towels. Place two pickles on each bottom bun; add a chicken breast, then the top bun. Makes 4 sandwiches Tidbits It is very important that your oil be hot for this recipe. Test the temperature by dropping some of the flour coating into the oil. If it bubbles rapidly, your oil is probably hot enough. It should take about 20 minutes to heat up. To make a \"deluxe\" chicken sandwich, simply add two tomato slices and a leaf of lettuce. Mayonnaise also goes well on this sandwich--it is a side order at the restaurant. more at topsecretrecipes.com",

        "Cooking_Steps": "First, make the dressing to allow time for the flavors to meld (you can do this up to a couple of days ahead of time). Stir all of the ingredients together in a medium bowl, whisking/mashing them with a fork well to combine, and store in the fridge until you are ready to use. That\u2019s it! This also makes a great veggie dip, so make extra if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. When you are ready to make the sandwiches, have the buns ready (I like to lightly toast them) and the lettuce and tomato cut into sandwich-ready slices. Heat a heavy skillet over medium high heat, and add enough oil to the skillet to coat the bottom well (2-3 Tbsp). While the skillet heats, season your chicken breasts well on both sides with salt and pepper. Dunk the chicken breasts first in the egg, and then dredge them in the flour, shaking any excess off. Fry the chicken breasts in the oil until they are golden brown on both sides and cooked through, 3-4 minutes per side. While the chicken cooks, melt the butter in a saucepan and add the hot sauce. Whisk well until it is combined, then take off the heat. When the chicken breasts are cooked through, remove them from the heat. Pour the hot sauce/butter mixture into a medium sized mixing bowl, and, working one at a time, place the still-hot breasts into the sauce, tossing them to coat. Make sure that the sauce is clinging to every part of each filet. Assemble the sandwiches by placing the saucy breasts onto the buns, and topping each with lots of the homemade blue cheese dressing, lettuce leaves, and slices of fresh tomato.

Working in two batches, place meat cubes in food processor and pulse until medium-fine grind is achieved, about 8 to 10 one-second pulses, scraping down processor bowl as necessary. Refrigerate ground meat immediately until ready for use.

When fully cooked, remove the pan from oven (keep oven turned on) and carefully drain off the liquid. Top the meat with an even layer of sliced cheese; return pan to oven for about 2 minutes or until the cheese melts. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for a few minutes.

Basket-weave the other 5 slices with the 5 on the workstation, making sure the weave is centered and each piece of bacon is equal in length. Place the seasoned patty on top of the weave, using your hands to compress the patty so that it does not go beyond the bacon. Starting with the vertical-facing slices, pull each end up and over the patty so that they meet in the middle. Begin weaving the horizontal slices into the vertical ones, lifting some slices and tucking the ends into others so that it resembles a near-perfect basket weave and it stays together well. Season both sides of the bacon-wrapped patty with a little bit of pepper. Preheat the grill to about 325 degrees. Add the burger, weaker side down, onto the grill and leave untouched until the bottom part has been seared together and the bacon is a crisp golden brown, about 15 minutes. Flip, cover, and cook for 5 more minutes. Uncover, and let the burger cook until both sides of the bacon-wrapped burger are golden brown and crisp, and the burger is cooked through and an internal temperature reaches 145 degrees, about 10 minutes more.

At this point, either cover and store in fridge/freezer for future use or continue on to finish making... In a small bowl, combine melted butter, mustard &amp; brown sugar. Stir until well combined (and the sugar is at least mostly dissolved). Then coat the tops of the rolls with the mixture. (I like to use a little pastry brush to make sure I get the tops evenly and a little on the sides). Bake at 350 for about 10-15 minutes (until cheese gets nice &amp; melty). Remove from oven and let cool a few minutes. Then cut, serve, and enjoy!",

Notes: They make round tortilla warmers like foam coolers that are usually less than$3, but any covered dish will do. You may need more flour than usual on your surface because these tortillas are slightly more soft which makes them easier to roll but also sticky if you dont use enough flour. I place a paper towel or cloth in the bottom of the warmer before I start adding the tortillas to prevent the bottom one from getting soggy from steam. If you like the fluffy tortillas like on a muchaco or gordita (sp?) at chain resturaunts you can add baking powder to this and make circles slightly smaller. They can also be deep fried into taco shell shapes after they are grilled.",

Remember to keep the oven door ajar when broiling and watch them closely so they dont burn! To assemble, place about 4 meatballs down the center of each flatbread.

Once they were done I drained out the remaining water, let them cool and then mixed an egg in with them. I then dumped the noodles onto a cutting board and spread them out until the pile was about a half of an inch thick all the way around. After that I cut two bread-sized square pieces of ramen out of the pile using a knife and placed each one between two pieces of wax paper and put them in my refrigerator. About 20 minutes later my newly created ramen noodle \u201cbread slices\u201d were holding together quite nicely so I took them out of the refrigerator and threw them into a pan on my stove where I heated them both up for a few minutes each on one side. Then, I flipped one of them over, added a couple slices of cheese, added the second one on top of it and just finished frying them like you would with a regular grilled cheese sandwich. When my Ramen Grilled Cheese was finished the noodles ended up nice and crispy on the outside, yet still soft and noodle-like on the inside. In a way ramen works almost better than bread in a grilled cheese because when the cheese melts it sort of fills in all the little nooks and crannies between the noodles. much more at http://dudefoods.com/the-ramen-noodle-grilled-cheese-sandwich/",

If the potatoes are new or good skins, DO NOT PEEL, just scrub well, then slice them 1/16\" in thickness, slicing across the potato. Sprinkle with your choice of spices or herbs or just leave them plain. If you have a microwave bacon tray, place the sliced potatoes flat on the tray in a single layer. Cover with a microwaveable, round heavy plastic cover. Microwave on HIGH (full power) for 7 to 8 minutes. Cooking time could vary slightly, depending on the wattage of your microwave. You do not have to turn the sliced potatoes over. If you do not have a bacon tray, use a microwave safe casserole dish. Rub the inside of the dish with some olive oil for the first batch of potato chips. I do not know why, but I find that if you do not rub oil the first time, some chips will tend to stick to the dish. After the first batch is done, you do not have to rub the dish again. Continue to microwave the remainder of sliced potatoes as noted above. NOTE: You can also use PARCHMENT PAPER to place your potato slices. Place your potato slices, then sprinkle them with whatever you like and then place another piece of parchment paper on top. This will help microwave the potatoes more evenly and they should turn out nice and crisp. ADDITIONAL SEASONING IDEAS: Granulated garlic powder with parsley.

        "Cooking_Steps": "Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Mash in a bowl with 1/2 teaspoon salt until no lumps remain. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion, green pepper, and garlic in the hot skillet until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 10 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high, and stir in the ground beef. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly and no longer pink. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, pepper, tomato paste, and vinegar until the tomato paste has dissolved. Scrape into a mixing bowl, and allow to cool to room temperature. Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap or waxed paper, and set aside. Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl, and set aside. Pour the bread crumbs and flour into separate, shallow dishes, and set aside. Once the potatoes and beef have cooled, form the potato balls: grab a handful of mashed potatoes, and split into two equal portions. Form each piece into a small bowl shape, and fill with the ground beef mixture. Place the two halves together, seal the edges, and smooth to make a round ball. Gently roll the ball in the flour to coat and shake off the excess flour. Dip into the beaten egg, then gently roll in bread crumbs. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that havent stuck can fall away. Place the breaded potato balls onto the prepared baking sheet while breading the rest. Refrigerate 2 to 4 hours, or freeze for later use. To cook, heat the oil for frying in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook the potato balls in the hot oil in batches, using tongs to roll the balls around as they cook to ensure even browning, until crispy and golden brown, about 3 minutes per batch. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.",

        "Cooking_Steps": "1 By Hand:. 2 Combine the flour, baking powder,salt, and optional dried pasta sauce mix. Either by hand or with a pastry cutter, cut in the shortening till the mixture is crumbly. If the mixture looks more floury than crumbly, be sure to add just one or two more tablespoons of shortening till it is crumbly. Add about 3/4 cup hot water to the mixture, or just enough to make the ingredients look moist. 3 With your hand or a large fork, knead the mixture making sure to rub the dough against the sides of the large mixing bowl to gather any clinging dough. If the dough still sticks to the side of the bowl, add a couple more tablespoons of flour until the dough forms a soft round shape. The dough is ready to roll out now, but it is best to let it rest. Cover it with a dish towel, and let it sit for about an hour or so. 4 Take the dough, and pull it apart into 10 to 12 balls. Lightly flour your rolling area, and roll each ball with a rolling pin to about 1/8 inch thickness. 5 Place each tortilla on a medium hot cast iron skillet. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until the tortilla does not look doughy. 6 Bread Machine:. 7 Combine flour, baking powder,optional dried pasta sauce mix, and salt in bread machine. Cut shortening into pieces about the size of olives, and drop inches. 8 Start mix cycle and slowly add tap water. Let cycle run five or six minutes, then stop machine. 9 Remove dough from bread machine, cover with a warm wet towel and let sit for 15 minutes, so dough can relax. (Do not skip this step or dough will be difficult to form into tortillas.). 10 Pinch off egg-sized pieces of dough and roll into balls. Use a rolling pin to roll them into thin rounds. 11 Heat a dry cast-iron skillet to medium. Transfer tortillas to skillet and cook until spots on the bottom are dark brown.

Pour onto the meat with the remaining Guinness; add the carrots and the thyme. Stir, taste, and add a little more salt if necessary. Cover with the lid of the casserole and simmer very gently until the meat is tender -- 2 to 3 hours. The stew may be cooked on top of the stove or in a low oven at 300 degrees F.
